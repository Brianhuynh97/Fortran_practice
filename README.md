# Fortran Learning Projects

Welcome to my Fortran learning projects repository. This repository contains various Fortran programs that I am developing as part of my journey to learn Fortran.

## About

I am learning Fortran by myself, and this repository serves as a collection of my exercises, projects, and experiments. Fortran, short for Formula Translation, is a powerful language especially suited for numerical and scientific computing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Fortran programs in this repository, you will need a Fortran compiler. Some popular options include:

- `gfortran` (GNU Fortran)
- `ifort` (Intel Fortran)
- `flang` (LLVM Fortran)

### Compiling and Running

To compile a Fortran program, use your Fortran compiler. For example, to compile a program named `example.f90` using `gfortran`, you can use the following command:

```sh
gfortran -o example example.f90
